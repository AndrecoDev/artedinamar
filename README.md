# Full Stack E-Commerce Website

### API DAtabase

- Build out the project to the designs provided
- Implementing cart functionality
- Connecting to Sanity as back end database for e-commerce

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework for Production
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) - Sanity is a customizable solution that treats content as data to power digital business.
- [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) - react library that adds beautiful notifications to our react application.
- [react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - JS library to add icons
- [swiper js](https://swiperjs.com/) - JS library to add slider component
- [canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti) - Lightweight JS plugin to create a confetti celebration explosion effect. It draws confetti graphics on the HTML canvas element.

### What I learned

The confetti effect is implemented on the payment success page after the user successfully checkouts their cart

### Continued development

The development of this project can be continued by adding a search filter functionality, an e-commerce newsletter, activate the slider function for product section in homepage. In the near future, I'm going to explore react js search filters and maybe add that functionality myself.
